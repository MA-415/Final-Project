## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

A <-matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), nrow=3,ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
A
A^3 #element wise or just *

A%*%A #matrix multiplication

A[,3] <- A[,2]+A[,3] #empty means all of them
A[1,1] <- A[1,2]*A[3,2]
A


diag(c(1,2,3),3,3) #diagonal
t(A) #transpose


```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

A <- c(1,2,3)
B <- c(4,5,6)
outer(A,B,"*")
outer(A,B,"+") #mult is default

sample(1:10,2) #random number generate

R <- matrix(sample(20, size=16,replace=T),nrow=4) #random matrix
R
```

```{r}
apply(R,2,function(x)(x>5))
which(apply(R,2,function(x)(x>5))) #finding things true or false
```

```         
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
